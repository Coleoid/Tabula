# Tabula

Generated code does not need to stink
    At least not in this case
    Optimized code, of course, can stink whether or not it's generated
    Runtime will be dominated by database and network
    Reporting time may deserve optimising (and won't use generated code)
    
Good error messages pay off for the developers
    We will be writing code around Tabula
    This is our primary constrained resource

Easy upgrade path for our huge quantity of existing Testopia tests
    Test scenarios easily (mechanically, or nearly so) upgradable
    Fixture workflows reusable likewise
