Behavior for AC-98989:
  Changing the class on a forecasting-accounting-activity
    will change the class on incurred expenses (IXes)
    attached to that activity.
  When this will happen, we alert the user and allow them to cancel.

Test cases for AC-98989:
    Alert only shows when the Activity has Incurred Expenses
        No IXes, no alert
        Has IXes, shows alert
    User can either cancel or proceed at that point
        Cancel does not change Activity or IXes
        Okay changes Activity and IXes

//  Then there can be more Behavior and Cases blocks as the scenario
//  grows to handle more cards.


Scenario:
    Create an Activity
    Create an IX with no activity and Class "Original Class"
    Change activity's Class to "Class One"
    Hit Save
    Verify no alert displays [shows 98989:'No IXes, no alert']
    Verify IX class still has original class ("Original") [shows 98989:'No IXes, no alert']
    Verify Activity has "Class One" [shows 98989:'No IXes, no alert']

    Attach our activity to our IX
    Change activity Class to "Class Two"
    Hit Save
    Verify alert displays [shows 98989:'Has IXes, shows alert']

    Hit Cancel on alert [for 2.a]
    Verify Activity still has original class ("One") [shows 98989:'Cancel...']
    Verify IX still has original class ("Original") [shows 98989:'Cancel...']

    Change activity Class to "Class Two"
    Hit Save
    Hit Okay on alert
    Verify Activity has "Class Two" [shows 98989:'Okay...']
    Verify IX has "Class Two" [shows 98989:'Okay...']

Notes:

  Agnostic on test case outline labels, as long as they're distinct
    Could prefix with 1:, 1.A:, etc., but maintenance bah...
    The Jira card number prefix on 'shows' looks clunky

  The 'Test Cases' lines get red/green highlighting.
    When the "[shows ...]" lines pass, the matching Test Cases are green.
    Any line failing will fail upward in the outline.
      In our example, if the last line failed, that would turn the...
        Okay changes Activity and IXes
      ...line to red, along with the 'User can either...' line two lines above it.
    Any test case line without a matching '[shows xxx]' in the scenario
      gets some different color to signal "Case isn't tested".

  Active row highlighting?  So that clicking 'User can either...' highlights it and the
    scenario lines tagged with it or its subcases ('Cancel...' and 'Okay...')

  Could also have a "go to..." link/icon to scroll to the first such line
    (Limited value?  Browser 'Find' is ~80% of that feature.)
