===  Future

Compiler tools for Studio
    Language highlighting?
    Auto-complete for steps (in scope?)

Better build-time value typing for float, double, decimal

Dev mode vs. Demo mode, different reporting

BDD styled >when: and >then:
    Raises questions of scope
    ...which run against the current usage of '>use:'
    ...perhaps outer-scope 'use' is '>install:'

Fixture-Binder
    Cache dumped when fixtures .dll newer than fixtures.json
    Deserialize from fixtures.json (tie parents, other init?)

Inner/child workflows

Numeric column indicators (#1, #2, et c.)
