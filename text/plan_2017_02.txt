=====================================================================
===  Tabula feature picks for February completion,  02 Jan 2017   ===

Update the Big Bad Wolf (1 pt)

Testopia runner:
    Split local/MVC into separate axis from Testopia/Tabula (.5 pt)

Update to_tabula.pl conversion script (2 pt)
    Resulting scripts compile on first pass
        Running correctly is out of scope
        Perhaps we collect failure results for later?
    Obsolete features commented out (whole step or part?)
        <== fails (with message)
        parens as comments


Results in JSON (3 pt)
    To be styled via mustache?

Labels matching "xxx: details" feed a Table of Contents (1 pt)
    / '"' (<-[:]>+) ':' \h+ (<-["]>+) '"' /
    Same with "set \h* up ':'? \h* '-'* \h*"
    Catch comments, too?

Colon optional after paragraph label
    (then steps must not start with string?)

Tabula internal stack trace getting solid and clear (2 pt)

Results to existing web-page mechanism (2 pt)

Overload resolution (2 pt)

Blocks (5 pt)
    Stack of code insertion locations (CILs)
        (where the first is into ExecuteScenario())
    When a new block opens, the current CIL gets the call
     to the new block, then the new block is pushed onto the stack


=====================================================================
===  Done

Update to_tabula.pl conversion script
    Add  // this .tab mechanically generated from Testopia (.5 pt)

Value aliases
    Syntax change:  >set: "foo" means "bar" (.5 pt)

Step aliases
    Syntax!  Means!  It's so beautiful! (.5 pt)
