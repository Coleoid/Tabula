===  Tabula feature picks for February completion,  02 Jan 2017   ===

Update the Big Bad Wolf (1 pt)

Testopia runner:
    Split local/MVC into separate axis from Testopia/Tabula (.5 pt)

Update to_tabula.pl conversion script (2 pt)
    Add  // this .tab mechanically generated from Testopia
    Resulting scripts compile on first pass
        Running correctly is out of scope
        Perhaps we collect failure results for later?
    Obsolete features commented out (whole step or part)

Results in JSON (3 pt)
    To be styled via mustache?

Labels matching "xxx: details" feed a Table of Contents (1 pt)
    Same with "set \h* up ':'? \h* '-'* \h*"

Results to existing web-page mechanism (2 pt)

Overload resolution (2 pt)

Blocks (5 pt)
    Stack of code insertion locations (CILs)
        (where the first is into ExecuteScenario())
    When a new block opens, the current CIL gets the call
     to the new block, then the new block is pushed onto the stack


=====================================================================

    Syntax change:  >set: "foo" means "bar" (.5 pt)
