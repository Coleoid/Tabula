String interpolation of variables for the debug message

Testopia runner
    [x] Pathway for running Tabula scenarios
    1.0
    [x] Reports minimally/adequately
    .25
    [x] Loads Tabula scenario classes dynamically
    .5

Compiler
    [x] Loads Binder from command-line args, uses it
    .25
    [x] Write class to output file
    .25
    [x] Prefix fixture type with namespace
    .25

Pragmatics and plumbing
    [x] 0.25  Update mechanical translation script to 16.12 Tabula
    [x] Manually add needed code to project for demo
        * Base classes
        * Generated scenario class(es?)
    .25
    [x] Finish translating TuitionBilling into Tabula
    .25

Fixture-Binder
    [x] serialize classes (json? .parent?) for compiler speed
    .5
    [x] Manually pre-build parent classes for inheritance
    .75
    [x] Keep Parent in Fixture-Class, populate from declaration
        delegate method finding at scenario compile-time
    1.0
    [x] Comprehend generic classes (enough)
        (perhaps very little if inheritance/partials are already in)
    .5
    [x] Handle connecting parent classes
    .5
    [x] Mop up remaining oddballs

Fire that nasty boy up, put out fires, repeat
    [x] several call bugs
    [x] comments not parsed correctly
    [x] numbers not handling decimals or sign
    [x] namespace missing on fixture instantiations
    [x] wrong constructor
    [x] class name includes path
    [x] public new void do_thing()
    [x] clear prior run's sections from regen
    [x] Fixture-Class fetching problems
    [x] Final handful of unfound (from multiple fixtures in scope)
    [x] Comma within string should not cause list
    [x] Label(string labelText) in base class
    [x] Values correctly typed (DateTime, numerics, enums)
