===  Tabula walking skeleton, remaining work  ===  05 Jan 2017

Fixture-Binder finishes enough of its education
    [ ] Mop up remaining oddballs
    .5
0.5

Compiler
    [ ] Decouple main loop some for smoother dev
    .25
0.25

Testopia runner wired through Tabula
    [ ] Loads Tabula scenario classes dynamically

    [ ] Reports minimally/adequately
    .25
    [ ] Scenario Context supplied to fixtures using it
    .5
1.25

Pragmatics and plumbing
    [ ] Finish translating TuitionBilling into Tabula

===  Beyond the skeleton


Testopia runner wired through Tabula

    [ ] split local/MVC into separate axis from Testopia/Tabula

    [ ] Reporting via existing web-page mechanism
    1.0 - 2.0

Dev mode vs. Demo mode

    [ ] BDD styled >when: and >then:
        Raises questions of scope
        ...which run against the current usage of '>use:'
        ...perhaps alternate large-scope 'use' is '>install:'
