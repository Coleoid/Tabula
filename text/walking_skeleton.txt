===  Tabula walking skeleton, remaining work  ===  30 Dec 2016


Fixture-Binder finishes enough of its education

    [ ] 1.00  Resolve methods available to class via inheritance
            At scenario compile-time, rather than at C# parsing-time

    [ ] 0.50  Comprehend generic classes (somewhat)

    [ ] 0.50  Comprehend partial classes (somewhat)
            Or pre-grind & special-case the Workflow base class partials?

    [ ] 0     Fixture-finding to catch 'workflow' embedded in name


Compiler builds class from head to toe

    [ ] 0.25  Loads Binder from command-line args, uses it

    [ ] 0.25  Write class to output file


Scope management

    [ ] 0.50  API:  open_scope, close_scope, add_row, add_var, resolve_var
            Create a scope object for value fetching, delegating outward

    [ ] 0.50  When running a table, insert row values into scope

    [ ] 0.25  var(string) delegates to scope.resolve_var to expose scoped values


Other runtime needs

    [ ] 0.50  Scenario Context supplied to fixtures using it


Testopia runner does Tabula

    [ ] 0.50  Loads Tabula scenario classes dynamically

    [ ] 0.25  Reports minimally/adequately
            Or 1.00 - 2.00 if reporting via the old mechanism
